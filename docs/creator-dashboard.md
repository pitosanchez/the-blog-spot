### Mock Data
The dashboard uses mock services in development mode:
- `creator.service.mock.ts` - Dashboard stats and creator data
- `content.service.mock.ts` - Posts and content management

### Testing the Dashboard

1. Sign up or login with test account:
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: password123

2. If logged in as a reader, visit `/become-creator` to upgrade

3. Access the dashboard at `/dashboard`

4. Try creating, editing, and managing posts

### Key Components

- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard requires authentication and creator role
- **Mock Data**: Realistic data for development testing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **State Management**: Integrated with app context
- **File Uploads**: Image optimization before upload

### Next Steps

The following dashboard features are ready for implementation:
- Analytics page with charts and insights
- Detailed earnings reports
- Subscriber management
- Creator settings and profile customization

### Technical Notes

- Uses React Router for nested routing
- Lazy loading for performance
